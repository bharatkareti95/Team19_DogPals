# Team19_DogPals #
This repository contains the source code for DogPals, a platform where new dog owners can connect with certified trainers and experienced dog owners who provide training services.

Changed working routines and increased time spent at home has resulted in an uproar in the number of dogs being adopted and bought. Along with increasing ownership, the demand for their grooming, training and other related services has surged. Given the wide range of training and services that are available, being a first time dog owner can be a daunting and time-consuming process due to the lack of exposure of what is available and what needs to be done. 
DogPals aims to provide dog owners a platform where they can connect with certified trainers and experienced dog owners who provide training services. The dog owners will then be able to compare, book, attend and review the various training sessions all on one application. The platform also aims to harness the power of shared resources and knowledge by creating communities of the various breeds to share tips or engage in common activities.
